  ## Description
  Movie-Night is a simple polling app with the great purpose of helping a group of people choose what to eat and watch for a movie night. Each individual votes on pre-selected choices from a food category and a movie category. The Host of the event will then tally up the votes to find the winning choices.

  ## Built With

* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - The CRA boilerplate that underpins this application.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React
* [React Router Dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - Our React Router w/DOM bindings.
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) -  Use for API calls. If I had my druthers, we would us fetch, but axios offers us way too nice a library for defaulting headers/response interceptors.
* [Use Persisted State](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-persisted-state) - A hook for a local storage state. I'm too lazy to write this.
* [Material ui](https://material-ui.com/) - React components for faster and easier web development.

  ## Installation
  For installing our app on your local device, you will need to do an npm install and have a mongoDB compatible tool to run the database.
